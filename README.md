# KeepItSafe  
Open ended software engineering task with a focus on microservice structure. I chose to make a password manager.  
The main content of the app uses JavaScript, React and MongoDB.  
My main personal goal for the project was to improve my JavaScript and React skills and to implement some higher level UI features.  
The app interfaces with two microservices:  
- [Random String Generator: coded by Alexandra Fren](https://github.com/alexandrafren/random-microservice)
- [Suggestion Search: coded by Yujun Liu](https://github.com/yujyuj/suggestion_search_microservice)
